The `docusaurus.config.js` is highly customizable and it would be too difficult to list all of its features and functions exhaustively here.

The config which comes with this repo has some comments embedded to help direct what a setting is for.

It is also very helpful to look at how Docusaurus themselves set up their own [website](https://docusaurus.io) which uses their own docs. You can see their set up [**here**](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/main/website/docusaurus.config.js).

You can also find a [**full reference**](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/docusaurus-config) to the configuration file.
