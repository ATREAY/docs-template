By default, the sidebars are defined in `sidebars.js` in the root folder of this repo.

Under the key `config > presents > docs > sidebarPath` is where the path to the `sidebars.js` is referred for the docs plugin for Docusaurus.

```js title="docusaurus.config.js" {8}
const config = {
  ...
  presets: [
    [
      "classic",
      {
        docs: {
          sidebarPath: require.resolve("./sidebars.js"),
        ...
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

Under the key `config > themeConfig > navbar > items > sidebarId`, you can specify the key ID that is defined in the `sidebars` variable in `sidebars.js`. As an example, this can be used if you want a different sidebar for a subset of docs.

:::note

Be aware that if you take the shortcut of using the type `autogenerated` and `dirname`, Docusaurus will recursively take all Markdown files in that folder and make it available on the sidebar.

The only way to prevent this is to explicitly define every page and category that you want in your sidebar. See [example](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/main/website/sidebars.js) from Docusaurus' website.

## Using `_category_.json` with autogenerated

:::tip

It is worth checking out the official docs regarding the [sidebar](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/items) and [autogenerated](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated).

:::

The `_category_.json` file is usually used in sub-folders where the autogenerate functionality is used. It allows you to tell the `autogenerate` feature to respect ordering and customize the category label for the folder that it appears as in the sidebar.

```json title="docs/advanced/configuration-files/_category_.json"
{
  "label": "Configuration Files",
  "position": 6, // position under in the sidebar under the advanced
  "link": {
    "type": "generated-index", // by specifying this, clicking on "Configuration Files" in the sidebar will create a generated page with a list of sub-pages that it contains
    "description": "Advanced customization of configuration files." // this will appear in the description under the title for the generated page
  }
}
```

If you _don't_ want to generate for when you click on the folder, you can delete the `link` key completely.

Or if you want it to point to a custom page instead of an autogenerated one:

```json
{
  "label": "Configuration Files",
  "position": 6, // position under in the sidebar under the advanced
  "link": {
    "type": "doc", // type must be doc
    "id": "deploy/install-index" //
  }
}
```

## Custom slugs

Under the `link` key, you can also specify the `slug`.

By default autogenerated pages have the URL as `{baseURL}/category/yourDirName`.

```json
{
  "label": "Configuration Files",
  "position": 6, // position under in the sidebar under the advanced
  "link": {
    "type": "generated-index", // by specifying this, clicking on "Configuration Files" in the sidebar will create a generated page with a list of sub-pages that it contains
    "description": "Advanced customization of configuration files.", // this will appear in the description under the title for the generated page
    "slug": "configuration-files" // specify your slug
  }
}
```

You can set the slug to something else if you want to omit the `category` subDir.
