# Raise issues

You can submit a documentation bug report or suggest documentation enhancements
by creating an issue in the documentation repository.

Before creating an issue:

- Confirm the problem. Clear the cache of your browser and check if the issue is still there. You can also disable all your browser plugins and see if the bug still happens.
- Perform a cursory search of documentation issues to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

:::note
If you find a closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.
:::

When creating the issue, use the following guidelines to help maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

- Use a clear and descriptive summary for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links, search keywords which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use backticks (```) to format the code snippets.
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Include screenshots or screen recordings which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
- Provide more context by answering these questions:

Did the problem start happening recently (for example, after a documentation update) or was this always a problem?
If the problem started happening recently, can you reproduce the problem in an older version of the documentation? What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
Include details about your configuration and environment:

- Which version of the documentation are you browsing? You can get the exact version by looking at the URL.
- What OS and version are you running?
- What browser and version are you running?
- What plugins/extensions and version have you installed and enabled in your browser?
