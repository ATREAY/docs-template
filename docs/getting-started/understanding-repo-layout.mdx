# Understanding repo layout

The purpose of this page is to describe the function of each file in this repo.

## 🗂️ `.github` folder

<details>
  <summary>See folder structure</summary>

    .github
    ├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE
    │   └── bug_report.md

        ├── pages-deploy.yaml
        └── release.yaml
    3 directories, 7 files

</details>

### 📂 `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`

Contains the bug report template when opening an Issue on GitHub. This can be customized to your needs. Note that by GitHub convention, this name cannot be changed.

### 📄 `pull_request_template.md`

Pull request template when pull request is opened. This can be customized to your needs. Note that by GitHub convention, this name cannot be changed.

### 📂 `workflows`

Contains all the GitHub Actions for the repo.

#### 📄 `build.yml`

Build the docs as it would in production to check for any build errors.

#### 📄 `case.yml`

Ensure that all markdown files have names which are only lower case letters, digits, dashes or underscores.

#### 📄 `lint.yml`

Run `npm run lint` from `package.json`. It includes spell checking, TypeScript linting, and CSS styling.

#### 📄 `pages-deploy.yaml`

Build and deploy the docs to GitHub Pages when any commit is made to the `main` branch.

#### 📄 `release.yaml`

Check all recent commits made to `main` branch and automatically cut a release in line with [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). The Action will read the configuration in `.releaserc.js` in the root directory of this repo.

## 🗂️ `.husky` folder

:::tip

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) manages Git hooks in an easy way and it is used in this repository for pre-commit, commit message, and staged linting so far.

    .husky
    ├── _
    │   └── husky.sh
    ├── commit-msg
    ├── pre-commit
    └── prepare-commit-msg

    2 directories, 4 files

</details>

#### 📄 `commit-msg`

On any commit message, `commitlint` will be run to ensure that it is compliant. The config used in this repo is the `config-conventional` found [here](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/blob/master/@commitlint/config-conventional/index.js). This is specified in the `package.json` on the `commitlint` JSON key.

#### 📄 `pre-commit`

Before a commit, `lint-staged` will be run which will check all staged files for spelling errors, TypeScript linting, and CSS linting. Settings for it can be found in `package.json` under `lint-staged` JSON key.

#### 📄 `prepare-commit-msg`

Commit message will use [git-cz](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), which has its settings in `package.json` under `config` JSON key. It uses `cz-conventional-changelog` which is the [conventional log standard](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog).

## 🗂️ `blog` folder

:::tip

Contains all the Markdown and related files for the [blog](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) functionality of Docusaurus.

:::

## 🗂️ `docs` folder

:::tip

Contains all the Markdown and related files for the [docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction) functionality of Docusaurus.

:::

## 🗂️ `src` folder

:::tip

Contains all the JSX and CSS files for [pages](https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages) functionality of Docusaurus.

    5 directories, 6 files

</details>

### 📂 `components`

Contains JSX components for React.js which should live separately from the [pages](https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages) folder. The pattern should be that JSX components are broken up here with `.tsx` extensions and accompanying scoped `.modules.css`. These components can then be imported by files in the `pages` folder.

### 📂 `css`

Any non-scoped `css` files should live in this folder.

:::caution

It is recommended to leave the default `custom.css` file by itself in this folder and not add any other files. The `custom.css` file is referred to as the [global](https://docusaurus.io/docs/styling-layout#global-styles) styles file which applies to the entire docs site.

:::

### 📂 `pages`

[Pages](https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages) are one-off standalone pages which do not have sidebars as default.

Markdown/MDX pages are still [supported](https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages#add-a-markdown-page) in this folder and will be rendered with the file name as the path.

[Routing](https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages#add-a-markdown-page) is file-based for any `.js` and `.tsx` file.

## 🗂️ `static` folder

Any assets which can be directly copied on build output. Usually images, stylesheets, favicons, fonts, etc.

More information: [Referencing your static asset.](https://docusaurus.io/docs/static-assets#referencing-your-static-asset)

  </details>

## 📄 `.cspell.json`

A [spell checker](https://cspell.org/) configuration file which is used in linting to check for misspelling in all files.

Configuration JSON file includes basic configuration with `ignorePaths` for paths/files which should not be checked. Additional dictionaries can be added, either default supported, or additional files, such as the `project-words.txt` included in this repository.

## 📄 `.editorconfig`

[EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/#overview) is supported by most IDEs and text editors to provide consistent coding styles for projects through a config specification.

## 📄 `.eslintignore`

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is used by this project since it contains Javascript, Typescript, and React code and lints the code to provide a consistent style for all developers and contributors.

The `.eslintignore` file are a list of directories for ESLint to ignore when linting.

## 📄 `.eslintrc.js`

Configuration for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and accompanying plugins used by it to parse and lint the code.

## 📄 `.gitignore`

A file containing files and folders for Git to ignore when adding or committing.

## 📄 `.nvmrc`

Contains the **Node.js** version that we want to use for this project. It requires the installation of [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating). See [here](index.mdx#installing-recommended-nodejs-version-with-nvm) for more.

## 📄 `.prettierrc`

It is recommended to use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format all files. Whatever is not covered in the `.editorconfig` will be overridden or specified in this Prettier configuration file.

When you `git commit` on this repo, `lint-staged` will run `npm run format` which will run Prettier to format and save those changes.

## 📄 `.releaserc.js`

[Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) is used to easily keep track of version changes to documentation. On push to the `main` branch, the `release` GitHub Action will take all necessary commits based on their type and increment the version according to [semver](https://semver.org/) conventions. However, it is not strictly necessary and can be removed along with its accompanying action if it is not preferred.

## 📄 `.stylelintignore`

[StyleLint](https://stylelint.io/) is used to lint CSS files. This file ignores directories which do not need to be linted.

## 📄 `.stylelintrc.js`

[StyleLint](https://stylelint.io/) configuration for linting.

## 📄 `CHANGELOG.md`

[Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) automatically updates the CHANGELOG file with release history and commits appended to each release. It should not be modified manually.

## 📄 `api.mustache`

This repo by default has the plugin `docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs` installed to demonstrate how to integrate OpenAPI documentation directly into Docusaurus. The `api.mustache` file contains the API template for the plugin when generating the Markdown files.

## 📄 `babel.config.js`

This is the Babel configuration which is used by Docusaurus. It should not be modified.

## 🦖 `docusaurus.config.js`

Contains all major Docusaurus configuration which is necessary to configure its behavior.

## 🔐 `package-lock.json`

Used by `npm` when `npm install` is used to lock versions and reduce differences between dev environments if this is not committed into the repository. It should not be necessary to edit this file directory.

## 📦 `package.json`

Used by [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json) containing configuration scripts, dependencies, dev dependencies and other related dependency configurations.

## 📖 `project-words.txt`

Used by `CSpell` in the `.cspell.json` configuration file with additional project words that should not be flagged as misspelling when linting.

## 🦖 `sidebars.js`

Separate `.js` file used by Docusaurus to provide sidebar configuration. It is possible to place this directly into `docusaurus.config.js` but has been separated for clarity and ease-of-use.

## 🦖 `tsconfig.json`

This project uses Typescript for React. The `tsconfig.json` contains Typescript compiler options but is not used in compilation of the project and only for editor experience.
