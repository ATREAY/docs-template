### 📂 `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`

Contains the bug report template when opening an Issue on GitHub. This can be customized to your needs. Note that by GitHub convention, this name cannot be changed.

### 📄 `pull_request_template.md`

### 📂 `workflows`

#### 📄 `build.yml`

Build the docs as it would in production to check for any build errors.

#### 📄 `case.yml`

Ensure that all markdown files have names which are only lower case letters, digits, dashes or underscores.

#### 📄 `lint.yml`

Run `npm run lint` from `package.json`. It includes spell checking, TypeScript linting, and CSS styling.

#### 📄 `pages-deploy.yaml`

Build and deploy the docs to GitHub Pages when any commit is made to the `main` branch.

#### 📄 `release.yaml`

Check all recent commits made to `main` branch and automatically cut a release in line with [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). The Action will read the configuration in `.releaserc.js` in the root directory of this repo.

## 🗂️ `.husky` folder

    .husky
    ├── _
    │   └── husky.sh
    ├── commit-msg
    ├── pre-commit
    └── prepare-commit-msg

    2 directories, 4 files

</details>

#### 📄 `commit-msg`

On any commit message, `commitlint` will be run to ensure that it is compliant. The config used in this repo is the `config-conventional` found [here](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/blob/master/@commitlint/config-conventional/index.js). This is specified in the `package.json` on the `commitlint` JSON key.

#### 📄 `pre-commit`

Before a commit, `lint-staged` will be run which will check all staged files for spelling errors, TypeScript linting, and CSS linting. Settings for it can be found in `package.json` under `lint-staged` JSON key.

#### 📄 `prepare-commit-msg`

Commit message will use [git-cz](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), which has its settings in `package.json` under `config` JSON key. It uses `cz-conventional-changelog` which is the [conventional log standard](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog).

## 🗂️ `blog` folder
