# Create new docs

This page contains information regarding how to fork this repo and quickly spin up your Docusaurus documentation and initial setup requirements.

To avoid duplication, [Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs) will not be rewritten in this repo. Instead, these docs will provide more _specific_ details for the **deployment, maintenance, and development** of Docusaurus in a manner consistent with the "ConsenSys Way".

:::tip Requirements

- Ensure that you have permissions in the [ConsenSys GitHub](https://github.com/ConsenSys) to create a new repository
- Have had a brief look at the [Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs)
- Familiarity with [Markdown](https://mdxjs.com/) syntax, specifically MDX
- General understanding of Javascript and [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)

## Steps to fork this repo

1. Proceed to this [repo](https://github.com/ConsenSys/docs-template). You can also click on the GitHub icon on the top-right of the navbar.

2. Click on the green `"Use this template"` button and on the drop-down `"Create a new repository"`.

   <details>
     <summary>See example</summary>
     <div>
       <img
         src={require("./img/useThisTemplate.png").default}
         alt="useThisTemplate"
       />
     </div>
   </details>

3. Fill out the details for your fork from the template. Please prefix the repo with `docs-` and then include your `project name`. For example, `docs-metamask` or `docs-infura`.

   <details>
     <summary>See example</summary>
     <div>
       <img
         src={require("./img/createNewRepository.png").default}
         alt="createNewRepository"
       />
     </div>
   </details>

4. Choose `Public`, `Internal` or `Private` depending on your needs. The difference between Internal and Private is that by default any ConsenSys member can see your repository if set as Internal, whereas Private will be completely invisible except to GitHub administrators of the organization.

5. After creating the repository, navigate to the `Settings` page which is on the far right side of the `<> Code` tab.

6. Ensure that the following settings are enabled/disabled from top to bottom for the General tab.

7. Go to the `Collaborators and teams` under `Access` on the left sidebar. Add `protocol-pliny` from the green `Add teams` button. Add any other relevant teams, such as your own as needed.

8. At the moment, it is not possible to easily use branch protection on `main` when using the `semantic-release` plugin. If you disable this, then branch protection can be enabled.
